With this package, one should be able to identify diffusing or electro-actuated single (nano)particles (most probably measured in on of the nanoCET setups), track their position and use tracking information to identify these particles and their dynamics

## Project Goals ##

    1. [] Identify presence of particles and their tracks as they pass through the field of view
    2. [] Use track information (position, intensity) to determine  diffusion constants and optical scattering cross section of individual particle and their distribution 
    3. [] Generate presentatble reports of particle size distribution or other characterized properties
    4. [] For electrophoresis experiments detemine the mobility of the particles
